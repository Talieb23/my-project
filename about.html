                     <p>When I was little I adored puzzles, riddles, and anything that involved creative problem solving. That passion 
                        <br>helped me to find my first love of Aviation. I have been an Air Traffic Controller for the past 22 years. Controlling
                        <br>the busy and complex traffic of Boston Logan Airport has assisted in improving my mental acuity, task switching skills, 
                        <br>and my ability to "think outside the box". This, in tandem with problem solving, quick reaction time, and persistence are 
                        <br>the key skills needed to peform in todays complex and technology driven world.  
                        <br>
                        <br>I have found that all of these transition well to the field of web development. The added element of creativity has 
                        <br>ignited a passion in me that I have not felt since my first day "talking to airplanes". That feeling of excitement around 
                        <br>learning something new and diving in "head first" has been wonderful! I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me!!
